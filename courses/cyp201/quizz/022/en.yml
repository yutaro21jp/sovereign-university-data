question: How is a public key calculated from a private key?
answer: By using scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve
wrong_answers:
  - By applying a hash on the private key
  - Through asymmetric encryption
  - With repeated addition of numerical values
explanation: |
  The public key is obtained by the scalar multiplication of the private key with the generator point G on the elliptic curve.
