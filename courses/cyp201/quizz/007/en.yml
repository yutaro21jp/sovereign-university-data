question: What is the main difference between ShR and RotR operations?
answer: ShR shifts bits by adding zeros, RotR reinserts the shifted bits
wrong_answers:
  - ShR removes the shifted bits, RotR multiplies their value
  - ShR shifts to the left, RotR shifts to the right
  - ShR is a logical operation, RotR is arithmetic
explanation: |
  ShR shifts bits to the right by adding zeros, while RotR performs a circular rotation of the bits.
