question: What is the difference between a compressed and uncompressed public key?
answer: The compressed public key uses only the x-coordinate and the parity of y
wrong_answers:
  - The compressed public key is more secure
  - The compressed public key uses only the y-coordinate and the parity of x
  - The compressed public key requires a larger private key
explanation: |
  A compressed public key retains only the x-coordinate and a bit for the parity of y, thus reducing its size to 33 bytes.
