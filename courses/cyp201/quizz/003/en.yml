question: What is the main difference between SHA256 and RIPEMD160?
answer: RIPEMD160 produces shorter hashes than SHA256
wrong_answers:
  - SHA256 is obsolete unlike RIPEMD160
  - RIPEMD160 is used only in the Proof-of-Work mechanism
  - SHA256 is never combined with other hashing functions
explanation: |
  RIPEMD160 generates 160-bit hashes, while SHA256 produces 256-bit hashes.
