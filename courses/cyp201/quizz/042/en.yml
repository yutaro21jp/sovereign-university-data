question: What is the main difference between a PRNG and a TRNG?
answer: The PRNG is deterministic, while the TRNG generates true random numbers.
wrong_answers:
  - The PRNG is faster than the TRNG for large numbers.
  - The PRNG is used only for encryption, not the TRNG.
  - The PRNG uses private keys, the TRNG uses public keys.
explanation: |
  PRNGs are deterministic, meaning they can reproduce sequences from an initial state, unlike TRNGs.
