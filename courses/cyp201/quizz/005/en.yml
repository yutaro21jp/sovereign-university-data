question: Why is irreversibility ensured in SHA256?
answer: The operations used remove information and are one-way
wrong_answers:
  - Messages are encrypted before hashing
  - Bits are rearranged randomly
  - Each hash is stored in a database
explanation: |
  Operations such as ShR and XOR make it impossible to return to the initial state, ensuring irreversibility.
