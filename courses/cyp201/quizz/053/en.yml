question: What happens if you lose the passphrase associated with your HD wallet?
answer: You lose access to the bitcoins linked to that wallet
wrong_answers:
  - You can still access the wallet with the mnemonic phrase alone
  - You can reset the passphrase by contacting Bitcoin support
  - You only lose the unconfirmed transactions
explanation: |
  The passphrase is an essential component in key derivation. Without it, it's impossible to recreate the keys and therefore access the bitcoins.
