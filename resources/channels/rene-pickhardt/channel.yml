  Weekly information about Bitcoins Lightning Network from a developer. I am an independent data science freelancer. I studied Mathmatics, Physics and Chinese and gathered 20 years experience in programming and software engineering. I try to upload a new video every Monday.

  As a former front runner for the pirate party during the 2017 federal election I am an  activist for open source, open educational resources and open access. Therefor the videos I create will be - if possible - openly licensed.

  Consider leaving a tip if you apriciate my work 1CWtSk58d3rN1R3oGwMobJ6Ets9E2gvPj5, you can also do this with more privacy with my lightning network node http://ln.rene-pickhardt.de
