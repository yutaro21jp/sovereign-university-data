  Welcome! I cover All Things Bitcoin to help you become financially self-sovereign in a world determined to control you. We live in a world bursting with potential but held back by a broken monetary system in which political and financial elites benefit at the expense of others through fiat currency debasement. Layer on the modern zenith of politics, big government, and collectivist morals, and we find ourselves in a softening society with destruction of wealth, encroachment on individual freedom, increases in inequality, and erosion of integrity and collaboration.

  As the saying goes, "Fix the money, fix the world"...
