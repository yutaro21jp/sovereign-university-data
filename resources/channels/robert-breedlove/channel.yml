  The "What is Money?" Show (WiM); a collection about Wisdom, Intelligence and Meaning is one of the most powerful philosophy podcasts in the world. Looking at human history through the lens of money and considering it's many definitions gives one a newfound appreciation for the subtleties of language and the effects of monetary systems on civilization.

  Hosted by Robert Breedlove, the mission of WiM is to cast light on the corruption of money and the cascade of negative consequences stemming from the biggest con in human history, central banking. Gaining a deeper understanding of the nature and history of money can help you "unplug yourself from the matrix" and see the patterns of the world in an entirely new light. By liberating your mind in this way you can become the change you wish to see in the world and help to enlighten those who are still in the dark.
