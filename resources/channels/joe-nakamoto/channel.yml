  Bitcoin investigations from around the world üåç 
  As a recovering mainstream journalist, I am obsessed with documenting, understanding and investigating Bitcoin.

  Why trust me?
  I've given talks or MC'd at Bitcoin and crypto conferences on 5 continents.
  I've used Bitcoin in more than 30 countries. 
  I've interviewed dozens of Bitcoin and Crypto CEOs, thought leaders and OGs.
  I've visited 10+ Bitcoin Circular Economies.
  I regularly embarrass myself with street interviews where I try to give away free bitcoin. 
  And I try to do this all in public, learning with you about this digital money movement.
