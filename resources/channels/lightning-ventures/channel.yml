  They are Bitcoiners investing in bitcoin companies and you can learn about angelinvesting, bitcoin venturecapital, or the world of startups and investing! Lightning⚡️Ventures is an exclusively Bitcoin-focused group of investors. A motley crew of folks dedicated to supporting Bitcoin-only companies. Meet founders, discover rad bitcoin startups, learn a ton, and other cool stuff. 😎

  They do interviews with founders when they have a live deal for their company in their Lightning⚡️Ventures syndicate and/or are investing through their bitcoin-only fund. What's a syndicate? It's a way for people to participate alongside the "suits" and invest in private companies with low minimums. 🤑 Great for learning! Real companies and real investments. No tokens or scam coins here.

  Bitcoin-only is all you'll see because crypto & blockchain are nonsense. Educating plebs and whales who want to learn more! Stay tuned for more fun shows and content. YGMI!
