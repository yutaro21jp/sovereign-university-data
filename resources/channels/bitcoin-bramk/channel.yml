  Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bram Kanstein, Bitcoin enthusiast and creative internet entrepreneur.

  I believe in the technology and promise of Bitcoin as a fair and open money network that will change the world for the better. To learn more about its impact and help my generation understand its importance, I started the 'Bitcoin for Millennials' podcast and share videos with thoughts on Bitcoin on this channel.
