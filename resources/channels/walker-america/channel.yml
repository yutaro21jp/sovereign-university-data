  My name is Walker. I'm here to talk about the separation of money and State. I'm the host of THE Bitcoin Podcast, a show for newcomers and seasoned psychopaths alike. THE Bitcoin Podcast is the best way to get started studying Bitcoin. I do long-form interviews with the best minds in the Bitcoin space, read Bitcoin articles out loud, read Austrian Economics writings out loud, and do Bitcoin News Roundups. There is no red, there is no blue, there is the State, and there is you.
