    Yo. We're Bitcoiners investing in Bitcoin companies and you can too! If you want to learn about our opportunities, angel investing, rad Bitcoin startups, and other cool stuff then listen up. We try to do interviews with founders when we have a live deal for their company in our Lightning⚡️Ventures Syndicate. What's a syndicate? It's a way for you to participate alongside the "suits" and invest in private companies. Mostly early-stage Bitcoin companies are what you'll see from us because that's what we do. We're new to the podcast format but hope to educate all the plebs who want to learn more!
