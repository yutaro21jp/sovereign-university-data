  Every Sunday, you could be used to get the 3 most insightful Bitcoin stories to
  level up your knowledge in 3 minutes. There, you can find memes too. However,
  such newsletter ended as it was in the previous format; from the mid of
  September 2024, youâ€™ll receive Bitcoin Minimalist in your inbox, a bi-weekly
  Bitcoin-only newsletter with Bitcoin news and analysis. Something in some ways
  different from Bitcoin Therapist, but the author, Jordan, writes banger emails
  (you will be in good hands).
