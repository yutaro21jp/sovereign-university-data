  TFTC (Truth for the Commoner) is a newsletter that provides a diverse mix of
  content covering bitcoin, economics, privacy, freedom technology, and culture.
  The goal is to be a trusted source of knowledge that helps readers separate
  truth from noise in the digital age. The newsletter's mission is three-fold: 1.
  Deliver a rich blend of carefully curated and self-produced content to inform,
  educate, and inspire readers. 2. Empower independent content creators by
  providing a platform to further monetize and reach a wider audience, leveraging
  bitcoin-powered tools. 3. Support the promise of bitcoin as a force that
  empowers individuals and creates a more level playing field. TFTC is passionate
  about fostering a sense of community and collaboration. The newsletter uses
  bitcoin monetization tools to share revenue with the independent creators whose
  work it curates, allowing them to continue producing high-quality content.
  Overall, TFTC aims to be a trusted gateway to truth, knowledge, and empowerment
  in the digital age, with a focus on bitcoin, economics, privacy, and more.
