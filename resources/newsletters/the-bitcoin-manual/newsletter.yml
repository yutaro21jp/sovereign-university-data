  The Bitcoin Manual is a passion project created by two morons, Che & Nicky, who
  fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole in 2016 (Che) and 2017 (Nicky). They met
  online through their respective blogs and shared a common goal of sharing their
  experiences about their ventures into Bitcoin. Theyâ€™ve decided to document their
  journey, share curated sources of bitcoin content with the goal of being the
  resource they would have wanted when first started their journey of learning and
  to help others avoid certain traps that are prevalent in bitcoin and the wider
  digital asset space.
