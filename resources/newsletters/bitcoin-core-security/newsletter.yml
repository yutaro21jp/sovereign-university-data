  Compared to the Bitcoin Core releases newsletter, this source is less common and
  provides insights on security issues at the time of public disclosure.
  This newsletter would be useful for those who want to be more aware of both resolved and potential issues, and especially for all of
  those searching for a solution to their own matters. This second category will probably include
  bitcoiner workers, developers and IT systemists.
