  Essays on Bitcoin Monetization. Gradually, Then Suddenly is an independent
  publication about Bitcoin. Not crypto, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most important
  innovation in the world and crypto is a grift. Bitcoin provides the world with a
  form of money, with a fixed supply, which no one can print. It is global,
  permissionless and resistant to all forms of censorship. The author believes it

  to writing.
