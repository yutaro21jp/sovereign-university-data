  Hundreds of news regarding multiple features of digital nomad life, with a
  focus on specific topics that are valid for few world countries at a time. This source
  provides valuable first-hand information on many important aspects from
  all over the world, making it a quick way to learn from other's people
  experience and avoid potential mistakes. Expert bitcoiners (but also intermediate ones)
  may decide to dig into it to know more about countries that are considered more exotic
  than their native ones, whether for work,
  tourism, longer stays or even resettlement. The Expat Network and its newsletter are
  backed by the Expat Network Ltd. company. However, it is
  unclear if this newsletter is still being maintained, as the last recorded
  message was on May 2023. Furthermore, some articles are not written from the
  Network itself, but are reposted from third-parties. Hence, some of them
  are not available anymore, especially the olders ones.
